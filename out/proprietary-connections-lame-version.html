   </h3>
<p>He was fast asleep on his bed. Alone. Jock at school, parties during his MBA, and a lot of cash at his job. Perfect. Until that night.</p>
<p>5 masked men broke into his house. Nobody felt their presence. Including him. Until a sharp knife penetrated his chest.</p>
<p>He tried to scream, but no sound was heard - he had already been gagged and bound. The knife was still lodged in his chest - close enough to his heart to hurt him a lot, but not close enough to kill him immediately. </p>
<p>The masked men then poured chilli sauce along the knife, watching him writhe in pain, straining at the ropes that bound his arms and legs. A delicate knife drew lines on one of his eyes. A pair of pliers were at work on his nails, and another at his tongue. A few other unmentionable and often unidentifiable instruments of torture and pain were used. </p>
<p>One of the men pulled out the knife, and used it to write something on the wall. A couple of shotgun shots to his palms and feet, followed by a call to Emergency Services for an ambulance, the masked men were gone. He would survive, but never really live again.</p>
<p>On the wall was written "The man responsible for Sony Ericsson's proprietary connection"</p>
