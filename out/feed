Very much. He had never felt like that before. The butterflies in his stomach were beating up a storm. He had never believed in love at first sight. Till he saw her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her waitress uniform made her look cuter than ever. He knew he had to ask her out. He drummed up enough courage, went to her and said 'Hi'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned, gave him a cute smile, and replied 'Hello uncle, what can I do for you?'&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">file:///home/yuvipanda/lemoncurry/out/premature-greying.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2009 16:02:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Carrier Error</title><link>file:///home/yuvipanda/lemoncurry/out/carrier-error.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The bus lurched to one side, and fell off the bridge. He felt his skull crack. He realized he had just seconds to live. One hand immobilized, he used the other to find the mobile. Two well practiced presses later, he was at the &lt;code&gt;Compose Message&lt;/code&gt; screen. Five seconds later, he had the words 'love ya' typed out. He hit send, and died peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five second later, an error popped up on the screen. &lt;code&gt;Unable to send message. Retry?&lt;/code&gt;. He wasn't alive to press &lt;code&gt;Yes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She never knew.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">file:///home/yuvipanda/lemoncurry/out/carrier-error.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2009 20:55:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Love</title><link>file:///home/yuvipanda/lemoncurry/out/treat-of-a-lifetime.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I promise her 'the Treat of a Lifetime'. I cook up a reason realistic enough for her to buy it. I bribe off everyone else to make sure she is alone. And she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walk along the sides of a typical city street. She is talking - she always is. When has she ever been quiet? Quiet is an adjective one doesn't use with the noun 'girl'. And she's no ordinary girl. She is my girl. Atleast, I hope she will be. I hope to know in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pizza Hut is in sight. She expects me to take her there. But I don't. I take her hand in mine and take a right turn, into a broken down building. She is surprised, but does not resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why are we hiding? Any of your relatives passing by?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like her talking style. I like her accent. Is there anything about her I don't like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, I am taking you to the treat"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'wtf' look consumed her face. She looks cuter than ever. When has she ever looked not-cute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she could do or say anything, I reach for the remote in my pocket and activate the holodeck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a second, we are at a beach. I can see a bunch of whales diving around at a short distance. Nobody was within eyesight. The sun was just about to set, and the waves reached just a few feet from our feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Where the hell are we?" She is confused and anxious. But not afraid. When has she ever been afraid of anything? Afterall, I fell for her - she can not possibly be afraid of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is Southern California, about 50,000 years before we were born"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Riiiiight. Who are you, a Q? You can't transport people back in time!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ofcourse I'm not a Q, dumbo. I can't transport people back in time.  I just recreated the beach in that old building. We never left that old building - this is that old building"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few sentences I explain to her how a holodeck can create any place we can imagine, and how I used it to make sure that the treat is, indeed, The Treat of a Lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a hard time believing it. With the gentle wind against her beautiful face blowing her hair up in a really, really cute way, even I have trouble believing that this was not a real beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start walking. Nobody speaks. The only sounds are the waves crashing and the distant whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't bear it anymore. I have to tell her, and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Remember the first day we met? At the Milan Cultural Festival?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sure I do! You were making a big fuss about not getting the top place in photography"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Remember what you said that day?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Huh?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You said you would be the happiest person on earth if you found a mermaid who could gift you a gold fish"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Huh? WTF are you memorizing these for?" Another slight arch of her forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to keep myself composed. "Well, look there"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I point at the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mermaid crawls on to the sand. She has a bowl with a golden fish in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"OMG What the hell did you do that for?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I did it because I want you to be the happiest person in the world. Because I love you. I love you"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tear rolls out of my eye. I had just said what I had been hoping to say since I first met her 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things seem to happen in slow motion. The breeze made her hair look damn cute. The setting sun made her beautiful face seem like a spectacular miracle. These few moments, from the time I closed my mouth and she opened hers, seems like an eternity. An eternity I could live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tear rolled out of her eye too. It sparkles like the diamond it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All these years, I was waiting for you to say it first"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart skips a beat. She has said yes. She is my girl. Finally, someone who loves me as much as I love them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hours later, the holodeck is powered down and she returns home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get beamed back to my ship. Duty awaits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">file:///home/yuvipanda/lemoncurry/out/treat-of-a-lifetime.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2009 23:06:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Emacs</title><link>file:///home/yuvipanda/lemoncurry/out/emacs.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;He was coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was on a bus, and coding. He had bought himself a cute little black Netbook just so he could open up Vim on a bus and code Python. He is a geek. A young, 18 year old typical geek. As typical as your usual geek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus was quite empty. It was late at night, this was proably the last bus for the day, and except the Driver &amp;amp; Conductor, there were probably 4 people on the bus. Including our geek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was until she got in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was younger than him. And pretty. Not pretty as in a 'OMG Dude that chick is HAWT!' pretty, but pretty as in 'Wow, isn't she darn beautiful?' pretty. She looked out of place in that shabby bus, alone at the late hour. Like someone had embedded a beautiful snippet of Python inside a messy tangle of Java written by an ex-VB developer who learnt programming in Turbo C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw her. "Nice hair", he thought. And went back to coding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five silent minutes went past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wow, what a Vim user! In the wild!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was startled. He was 'in the zone', and when you're the zone, everything outside your screen is just a blur. The blur slowly started sharpening itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned back. It was her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Huh?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Your editor? It's Vim"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Huh huh?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So you're not a real programmer. &lt;a href="http://www.xkcd.net/378/"&gt;Real programmers use emacs&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Eh?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/realprogrammerspython"&gt;real programmers don't use Python&lt;/a&gt; either. &lt;a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html"&gt;We code in C&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Erm, wha? Huh?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes, C. And Emacs. Vim is for Wimps. You would probably run windows on that thing if you could've. You are a total waste of space"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What the?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She timed it to perfection. The bus stopped. She got down, blew him a kiss, and went on her merry way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He never forgot.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">file:///home/yuvipanda/lemoncurry/out/emacs.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2009 02:25:27 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
